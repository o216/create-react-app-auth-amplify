        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The Jubily mobile application and website increases equitable access to healthcare and improves healthcare outcomes
          by connecting people to culturally competent clinicians and online communities of support.
        </p>

        <p>Word of mouth referrals are outdated.
          Jubily democratizes the referral process by leveraging technology using our research-based algorithm to connect patients and clinicians based on important search criteria that have been linked to effective and efficacious treatment in medical and mental health research.
          We also know that social support systems are crucial to effective  treatment.
          Jubily also provides a place where people who struggle with different illnesses (e.g. cancer, anxiety, depression etc.) can go to connect with an online  community  of support with other people who are or have gone through similar experiences to help them cope.
          We also provide an online community of healthcare professionals where clinicians can easily connect with other clinicians across specialties for advice and for referrals as this is  also currently missing in the marketplace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jubily fills a gap in the marketplace by providing one comprehensive, centralized healthcare hub where medical and mental health care professionals are included in our search engine.
